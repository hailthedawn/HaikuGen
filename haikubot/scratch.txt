Overarching structure:
-> A folder of files trained with
-> A file with haikus generated using the algorithm
-> code folder
   -> a training file that 1) reads in the files, 2) makes a text model, 3) uses it to generate 3 sentences that follow
                                                                             haiku restrictions

1) TODO: see how to deal w/ the file paths so you're using relative ones and not absolute ones
2) TODO: do i save the model? why would one choose to save the model?
3) TODO: have all 3 of them share the same sentiment. / if finding stuff like this is hard, simply generate whatever
         and if they happen to share the same sentiment, write it to the file.
